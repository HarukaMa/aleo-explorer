# Aleo Explorer

[The "official" instance](https://explorer.hamp.app)

## Description

A blockchain explorer for Aleo.

It contains a node that connects to another peer to fetch blockchain data. This node is NOT validating blocks. Only
connect to peers that you trust.

## Database update warning

The database schema has been updated at the start of testnet 3 phase 3. It's recommended to start clean and import the
database schema from `pg_dump.sql`.

Further schema updates will be provided as database migrations.

## Prerequisites

* Postgres 12+
* Rust latest stable
* [aleo-explorer-rust](https://github.com/HarukaMa/aleo-explorer-rust)

## Usage

1. Import the database schema from `pg_dump.sql`.
2. Configure through `.env` file. See `.env.example` for reference.
3. Run `main.py`.

### Use in docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## A better frontend?

Yeah, I'm not really a frontend developer. I know it's ugly, but I'm focusing on features here.

You are welcome to contribute a better frontend, as long as you keep the current one as a function baseline reference.
You can also create an entirely new frontend outside this repository; all you really need is the blockchain data in the
database.
